SkReflectabase is a Java Plugin that consists of bare bones classes for use with **Skript-Reflect** to allow Skript to interact with MySQL Databases without an Addon or Built in Syntax that needs to be developed. Need an update before I can get to it? Throw the source code in ChatGPT and have it update it for ya. Will be updating for each Minecraft version.
